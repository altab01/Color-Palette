# Color-palette
[This project is a Color Palette Generator web application built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a tool that allows users to upload an image and extract the dominant colors from that image, creating both a main color palette and complementary colors.
The application demonstrates strong front-end skills including:
Advanced DOM manipulation
File handling and processing
Canvas-based image processing
Complex mathematical algorithms implemented in JavaScript
CSS for creating an intuitive user interface]
